00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.280
Kahn? 

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.100
Khan, you've got Genesis,

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.190
but you don't
have me.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200
If you're going
to kill me, Khan,

5
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.070
you're going to have to
come down here!

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.290
I've done far worse
than kill you.

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.220
I've hurt you.

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.060
and I wish to go on
hurting you.

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.240
I'shall leave you
as you left me–

10
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.290
as you left her–

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.090
marroned for all
eternity

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.000
in the center 
of a dead planet

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.030
Buried alive eternity

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.000
KHAAAAAAAAAN!
