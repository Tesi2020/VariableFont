You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?


00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.090
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?


00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.020
They got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.


00:00:09.100--> 00:00:11.000
What do they call it?


00:00:11.100--> 00:00:13.000
They call it a Royale with Cheese.


00:00:13.250--> 00:00:15.000
Royale with Cheese.


00:00:15.010--> 00:00:16.000
That's right.


00:00:16.100--> 00:00:17.150
What do they call a Big Mac?


00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.000
Big Mac's a Big Mac.
But they call it Le Big Mac.


00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.150
Le Big Mac.

[MRS. TEEVEE] What's happening to him?


00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100
[MR. SALT] He's drowning.
[MRS. GLOOP] Dive in!


00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.110

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.070

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.050
Too late?


00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.220
He's had it now.


00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.000
The suction's got him.


00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.000
[MRS. GLOOP] Augustus. come back!


00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.500

Watch the pipe.


00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.050
[VERUCA] How long is he going to stay down daddy?


00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.090
[MRS. GLOOP] He can't swim!
[WONKA] No better time to learn.


00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.120
[VIOLET] His coat's going up the pipe!
[MR. BEAUREGARDE] Call a plumber!


00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.100
[MR. SALT] He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?


00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.220
It's his stomach.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.130
What happens now?


00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.900
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.


00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
MR. SALT: How long will it take
to push him through?


00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.150
The suspense is terrible.


00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.230

00:03:08.10 --> 00:03:09.070
A fucking yacht?

For millionaires
whose ships have come in,


00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.190
pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.


00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.290
It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull


00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.100
is the color of cash. Anchors aweigh!

The Allies have taken Italy.


00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.400
France will be next and soon the war will be over.

Goddamn it! Why does that make you happy?


00:03:40.60 --> 00:03:42.500
You hate your country that much?


00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.010
I love my country. It's the war I hate.


00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.500
It's pointless and stupid,


00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.100
and the sooner we have peace, the better.


00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.040
Oh, the war will end.


00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.900
We will crush our enemies into dust.


00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And when they are destroyed.


00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.000
we shall use their graves as toilets.


00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.170
Okay. No more politics.

Dinner is neutral ground.
This table is Switzerland.

If you want to win the war tonight,


00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
we have to make a deal.


00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.070
What kind of deal?


00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.


00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:20.000
However, I'm sure this mission
of yours has a commanding officer.


00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.900
A general.


00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I'm betting for...


00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.110
OSS would be my guess.

Is that the way you say
it? "That's a bingo."


00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.120
Tony...


00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.060
...I'm scared.


00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.500
Live long and prosper.
